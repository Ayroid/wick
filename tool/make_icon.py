"""Regenerate the launcher icons from the source art in art/.

Sources (hand-made, never written by this script):
    art/mascot-source/wick_<pose>.png   the six poses, ~1254px, RGBA
    art/mascot-source/icon_source.png    the launcher crop: breathing room
                                         above the leaves, body bleeding off
                                         the bottom edge

Outputs (generated, never hand-edited):
    assets/icon/app_icon.png             iOS: whole square, opaque cream
    assets/icon/app_icon_adaptive.png    Android: the crop inside the safe
                                         centre 2/3, transparent

Run after changing the icon art:     python3 tool/make_icon.py

The six poses and assets/splash/wick_mark.png were derived once by hand and are
left alone — re-deriving them would rewrite bytes and move the goldens for no
visible gain. Pass --poses or --splash to regenerate them deliberately.
